<h3>Reflections</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What new skills have you learned?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Virtually everything I've learned has been new. Prior to this course my only exposure to HTML was formatting content in a PowerShell script for an auto-generated email. Perhaps the most valuable skill I've gained is learning how to navigate the HTML help sites.</li>
			</ul>	
		<li>What has been easy?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The class material, construction, and delivery have been a refreshing breeze thus far. Also, this content and challenges of the course have been relatively easy, but I'm sure that will change soon :)</li>
			</ul>	
		<li>What has been difficult?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>I can't say that anything so far has been <em>difficult</em>. I'm actually looking forward to the inevitable progression of the coursework.</li>
			</ul>	
		<li>How have you used the problem-solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>MARKUP VALIDATION SERVICE</strong> has been a huge help to me when testing my code. I also find myself hitting Ctrl+R in my browser as often as possible to validate my code iteratively rather than at the end.</li>
